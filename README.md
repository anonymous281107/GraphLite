```

**Step 2:**

Go to project root and execute the following commands in console to get the required dependencies:

```

### Building a release APK

Go to project root and execute the following commands in console to clean build the release APK: 

```

flutter build appbundle --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64
```

### Before you push a commmit

* Make sure that all the code is commented and legible variable names are used. Do not have any unnecessary overheads or redundant code.
* The code is formatted using the in-built dart formatter for the respective IDE being used with commas (,) placed at the appropriate positions to enhance readability.
* All local imports are replaced with the complete path to the file (example :- `import 'package:floatingbubble/constants/enums.dart';`)
* Always import flutter core libaries, followed by any external library and then the local files in the end.

### When to create a new Branch

A new branch is to be created for new feature with an appropriate name. For example, when adding the video-conferencing feature, one should create a new branch from the main branch named floatingbubble-customtheme (There is no set naming nomenclature that one has to follow. Just use legible branch name)
